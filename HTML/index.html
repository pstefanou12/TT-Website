				Theta Tau is the only <b>Professional Engineering Fraternity</b> at MIT. As the nation's oldest and foremost fraternity for engineers, Theta Tau focuses on developing leaders for profession, service, and brotherhood. This mission is embodied in our Brothers, a group of men as diverse as they are accomplished. Scholars, innovators, athletes, startup founders, and philanthropic organization directors all call our house -- a beautiful five story brownstone in the Back Bay of Boston -- their home. We believe that our organization is strong because of the people who make it up, and stronger because of those who support it. On behalf of the whole Technology Colony, welcome to our website where you can learn more about our organization, members and activities.

				In the spring of 2015, freshman Kyle Archer and sophomore Kelly Mcgee noticed the lack of a professional engineering fraternity at MIT, despite the existence of professional engineering organizations at almost every school in the nation, including USC, University of Wisconsin, and University of Rhode Island. They thus sought to bring Theta Tau, the oldest and largest fraternity, to MIT. Gathering together a group of fellow engineers, Kyle and Kelly met with MIT FSILG and national Theta Tau administrators to make their dream a reality.<br> 
				The MIT Colony of Theta Tau was officially established in spring 2016, with a total of 50 founding members. Moving quickly, the colony held its first rush and initiated their first pledge class within the next few months.<br> 
				MIT Theta Tau became a recognized national chapter in the spring of 2017. We're becoming a bigger family each and every semester! How exciting!
